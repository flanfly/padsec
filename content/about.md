The Practical And Defensive SEcurity Conference (PADSEC) is an emerging
community that aims to understand real-world security problems and their
technical solutions.  PADSEC is intended as a pop-up conference that _pops-up_
at existing events.  Not having a fixed venue will likely increase the diversity
of attendees in the long run.  This is important because we hope to connect
problems that need solutions with solutions that need problems by providing a
meeting point for people with different backgrounds.

We welcome contributions in the form of _talks_ that are technical, defensive,
and practical.  You do not need a paper or be working towards one.  The
motivation of your work is most likely a real-world problem or an identifiable
threat.  The proposed solution, if any, should ideally not undermine other
important system properties like performance, availability, ease of use, and
compatibility.

You can attend as a presenter of a problem talk (without having a solution), a
presenter of a full talk (by having a usable solution or analysis), or as an
attendee that takes part in open-ended discussions.  Attendance is _not
restricted_ to academics, engineers, etc.  The list of topics that define our
technical scope is defined separately for each CFP, see events.
